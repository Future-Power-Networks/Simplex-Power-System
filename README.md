## Introduction

This project contains materials for getting the results of the duality theory of inverters. These codes are specially customized for the case study in the article, so do NOT create your own case upon these codes as they may generate unwanted results. If you hope to develop your own project based on our toolbox, please use the up-to-date version in the master branch [here](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool).

## Notes for Single-Inverter and Two-Inverter Systems

Models and scripts are saved in folders "SingleInverterCase_Simulation", "SingleInverterCase_Script", "TwoInverterCase_GflGfm", and "TwoInverterCase_TwoGfl".


## Notes for 14-Bus System

The results are generated by an old version of our toolbox. For using this old toolbox, please use Matlab 2020b, and run "Install.m" first, and then run "UserMain.m" for getting the theoratical analysis, and finally run the corresponding simulink model in folder "MultiInverterCase_Simulation". Excel forms in folder "MultiInverterCase_Simulation" contain the system paramters for different cases.
