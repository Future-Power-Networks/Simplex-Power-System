# Simplus Grid Tool (Version: v2024-Aug-19)

This branch is for the simulation and analysis of an IEEE 68 bus system. The codes are based on Simplus Grid Tool (SimplusGT in short), which is an open-source tool for dynamic analysis and time-domain simulation of power systems (large-scale 100+ bus systems, SG-IBR-composite systems, AC or DC or hybrid AC-DC systems, HVDC systems, etc).

## System Requirement

Matlab 2020a or later, with Simulink, Simscape/PowerSystem.

## Quick Start

Copy the repository (download all codes) into your PC, and run "InstallSimplusGT.m" by Matlab. That's all! 

Run "UserMain.m" and you will automatically get results of an example 4-bus power system whose default parameters are saved in "UserData.xlsm". More examples can be found in "Examples" folder.
