# Simplus Grid Tool (Version: v2022-FEB-24)

This is an old version of toolbox for obtaining the results of our paper that analyzes the inertia-free power systems. The data is mainly saved in "Simulation" folder. For runing the simulation, please run "InstallSimplusGT.m" first, and "UserMain.m" next. Please use the newest version of this toolbox [here](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool/tree/master) if you want to develop your own projects because the codes in this branch have been modified to faciliate the analysis in the paper.

## System Requirement

Matlab 2015a or later, with Simulink, Simscape/PowerSystem.
