# Simplus Grid Tool (Version: v2021-Jun-25)

This branch is archieved for the case studies in the paper "Impedance Margin Ratio: a New Metric for Small-Signal System Strength" in IEEE Transactions on Power Systems. For more functions, please refer to the main branch of [Simplus Grid Tool](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool).

## Quick Start

1) Open Matlab, and include all folders and subfolders of this repo in Matlab's path.
2) Open UserMain.m in the root path of the repo, select the case, and click run.
3) Results can be viewed from workspace, or more conviently, from the newly designed Modal Analysis APP.
4) Simulink model for time-domain simulation can be found in 'Simplus-Grid-Tool\IMR_case'. (you have to run InstallSimplusGT.m to install Simplus Grid Tool simulink library)
