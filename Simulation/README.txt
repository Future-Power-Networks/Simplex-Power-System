"ScopePlot.m" can be used to quickly test the simulation results.

Rcap = 0.00001 and Ccap = 0.03/Wbase for simulation. They are set in "UserMain.m".

For testing three-phase balanced fault:

The simulation results of conventional test is done by decimation of 30. Fault starts from 2.5s. Simulation runs from 0s to 4.5s.

The simulation results of inertia-free test is done by decimation of 120, because of longer simulation time. Fault starts from 8.5s. Simulation runs from 0s to 10.5s.

For testing unbalanced ABG fault:

For high and medieum inertia tests, fault starts at 2.5s and simulation ends at 4.5s. For low inertia test, fault starts at 8.5s, simulation ends at 10.5s.
