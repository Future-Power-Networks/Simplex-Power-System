Layer 1 (Apparatus Participation Factor): 

This layer helps you quickly determine the potential participants of the selected mode.

Layer 2 (Damping and Frequency Sensitivity): 
This layer shows the variation of the mode in both real and imaginary part when increasing the impedance of the apparatus (equivilently as scaling down). 
General principle: if a positive bar is found in damping plot,  it implies that scaling up the corresponding apparatus connected at the node tends to stabilize the system , and vice versa. 
All values are normalised to 1.

Layer 3 (Parameter Sensitivity):
This layer tells you how to tune the paramters to shift the mode leftwards.

Small-signal Strength:
Value of impedance margin ratio (IMR) gives you the small-signal system strength at different locations.
