I prepared a SimpluGT/Excel file for IEEE 59 bus/Australian 14 generator system.
This system is one of the IEEE benchmark systems for the SSSA based on the IEEE PES Technical Report 18 (Benchmark Systems for Small-Signal Stability Analysis and Control) and its paper entitled "Benchmark Models for the Analysis and Control of Small-Signal Oscillatory Dynamics in Power Systems". 
I prepared this file based on IEEE-PES-TR18 accompanying reports and data files for the Australian system (available at https://cmte.ieee.org/pes-psdp/benchmark-systems-2/).
First, I prepared the MATPOWER file ‘case59’ for this system (using LF_Case01_R4_S.raw) and ran it successfully on MATPOWER. 
Then, I prepared the Excel file for SimplusGT (using case59 data and the Australian system report, which includes generator data).
Specifically, I used the report entitled "Simplified 14-Generator Model of the South East Australian Power System" and LF_Case01_R4_S.raw available in AU14GenModelData_Ver04.zip. 
Six load cases are available for this system, and I created case59.m and IEEE_59Bus_TR18.xlsx for load case 1. 
It is possible to repeat the procedure for other load cases. 
I provided further explanations about Bus and Network data in the case59 file. 
The system frequency is 50 Hz.
For Apparatus data, generator data is available in the report. 
In it, H and wL (X) values are available. 
Also, for D and R, 0 has been considered. 
I changed D and R values.
I set D=1/4*H like NET_NYPS_68Bus.xlsx.
Also, I considered a small number for R equal to 0.0001.
