# WSCC_9Bus

The test model is (an approximation of) the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 3-machine, 9-bus system.

This system, while small, is large enough to be nontrivial and thus permits the illustration of a number of stability concepts and results [2].

Information for this system is available thourgh multiple resources or their previous versions.
